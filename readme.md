Coding Challenge: Analyze Historical Bitcoin Prices
Objective:
The goal of this challenge is to analyze historical Bitcoin prices and perform basic data manipulation tasks. You will work with a dataset containing daily Bitcoin prices, and your task will be to calculate key statistics, visualize trends, and derive insights from the data.

Tasks:
Load the Dataset:

Load the dataset containing historical Bitcoin prices into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspect the Data:

Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Check for any missing values and handle them appropriately.
Calculate Basic Statistics:

Calculate the average (mean), median, and standard deviation of Bitcoin prices.
Identify the highest and lowest prices in the dataset.
Visualize the Data:

Plot the Bitcoin prices over time using a line chart.
Create a histogram to show the distribution of daily price changes (i.e., the difference between the closing price of each day and the previous day).
Moving Average Calculation:

Calculate the 7-day and 30-day moving averages of Bitcoin prices.
Plot these moving averages on the same chart as the original price data.
Find the Best Day to Buy and Sell:

Identify the best day to buy Bitcoin (lowest price) and the best day to sell Bitcoin (highest price) within the dataset.
Calculate the maximum possible profit if someone bought on the best day to buy and sold on the best day to sell.
Bonus Challenge:

Implement a simple trading strategy based on moving averages (e.g., buy when the 7-day moving average crosses above the 30-day moving average, and sell when it crosses below).
Dataset:
Here is a potential dataset for you to work with. It contains daily historical Bitcoin prices from 2014 to 2021:

Columns:
Date: The date of the recorded prices.
Open: The opening price of Bitcoin on that date.
High: The highest price of Bitcoin on that date.
Low: The lowest price of Bitcoin on that date.
Close: The closing price of Bitcoin on that date.
Volume: The trading volume of Bitcoin on that date.
Market Cap: The market capitalization of Bitcoin on that date.

Financial Concepts Covered:
1. Price and Market Data Analysis
Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC):
These are standard metrics used in financial data to describe the price movements of an asset within a specific period (e.g., daily):
Open: The price at which Bitcoin started trading at the beginning of the day.
High: The highest price reached during the day.
Low: The lowest price during the day.
Close: The price at which Bitcoin ended trading at the end of the day.
Volume:
The total amount of Bitcoin traded during the day. It indicates the level of activity or liquidity in the market.
Market Capitalization:
The total market value of Bitcoin, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total number of Bitcoins in circulation. It gives an idea of the overall size and value of Bitcoin in the market.
2. Statistical Measures in Finance
Mean (Average) Price:
The average closing price over a given period, which gives you a sense of the general price level.
Median Price:
The middle value of the closing prices when sorted, helping to understand the central tendency without being skewed by extreme values.
Standard Deviation:
A measure of volatility or how much the price of Bitcoin fluctuates around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates higher price volatility.
3. Trend Analysis
Moving Averages:
A moving average smooths out price data to help identify the direction of the trend. For example:
7-day Moving Average: A short-term trend indicator.
30-day Moving Average: A longer-term trend indicator.
Crossover Strategy (Bonus Task):
A common trading strategy where you buy or sell based on the crossing of short-term and long-term moving averages.
4. Investment Timing
Best Day to Buy and Sell:
This concept explores identifying the optimal days to buy (at the lowest price) and sell (at the highest price) to maximize profit, which is the essence of "timing the market."
Maximum Possible Profit:
The difference between the highest and lowest prices within a given period, representing the best possible return you could achieve if you bought and sold at the perfect times.
5. Risk and Return
Volatility:
This is often assessed using standard deviation and moving averages. Volatility is a key concept in finance as it reflects the risk associated with an asset's price movements.
Risk Management (Implicit):
Although not directly covered, by analyzing price trends and volatility, you implicitly touch on risk management, as understanding these factors helps in making more informed investment decisions.
6. Historical Performance Analysis
Backtesting (Bonus Task):
By implementing a trading strategy and applying it to historical data, you simulate how the strategy would have performed in the past. This is a form of backtesting, which is used to assess the viability of a trading strategy.
7. Market Behavior Insights
Distribution of Daily Returns:
By creating a histogram of daily price changes, you gain insights into how often Bitcoin experiences small versus large price movements, which is key to understanding market behavior and risk.
8. Technical Analysis
Support and Resistance Levels (Optional Extension):
These are not directly covered but can be inferred from trend analysis and moving averages, where support is the price level Bitcoin rarely falls below, and resistance is the level it rarely exceeds.
